## Overview

### The challenge

The challenge is to build out this landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

One can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

**Users should be able to:**

-View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
-See hover states for all interactive elements on the page


### Screenshot

![Final Screenshots]()

This is a screenshot for a laptop size screen, 1440 * 900. I had issues setting up the background curvy image on different screens but I eventually came up with this.

### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- [CSS Grid](https://css-tricks.com/look-ma-no-media-queries-responsive-layouts-using-css-grid/)
- [CSS Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/)
- [Mobile-first design](https://css-tricks.com/how-to-develop-and-test-a-mobile-first-design-in-2021/)
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/dart-sass)

### What challenged me!
- I realized, I have a lot to learn about pseudo elements and the **background images**
### What I learned

- I got deeper into the background images, their sizing as well as their positioning. I still have a long way to go but am really happy with the progress.
- I am also glad that I am getting more comfortable with sass.

- It is always fun to work with both grid and flex layouts.

### Useful resources

- [Google](https://www.google.com) - Definately **THE** most valuable tool in a web developer's **TOOLBOX**, frontend or backend. Any search engine would do, though.
- [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/) - This is one of my go-to platforms. It is full of articles that are clearly and broadly explained by people with vast knowledge of CSS.
